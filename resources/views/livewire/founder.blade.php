                        <h2>Conway Stanley </h2>
                        <p class="mb-20">Is not only a gifted and outstanding English teacher, but his accomplishments as an entrepreneur have proven to be noteworthy. As a graduate of Bechet College of Education in 1988, he went on to teach English and Mathematics at a high school in his hometown, Durban. Conway’s 30-year career has seen him teaching ESL in South Korea, Dubai and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He has served in a number of strategic roles, some of which are; Headteacher at Global Education Center, Academic Director in Riyadh and Curriculum Developer for more than one company. </p>
                        <p class="mb-20">Teaching has not been his only passion. Conway has proven to be quite the serial entrepreneur. His first foray into the business world was in 2007 when he opened GEC Recruitment and Training in Cape Town. He then went on to establish Pinnacle Learning Academy in 2015, and though these enterprises proved to be successful for a while, he was still searching for the one thing that he knew was still missing. </p>
                        <p class="mb-20">His latest accomplishment is the establishment of a European company based in Dublin, Ireland called STANLEY EDUCATION AND TRAINING ACADEMY. SEATA is the holding company of all his iTTi branches around the world. STANLEY EDUCATION AND TRAINING ACADEMY (SEATA) is already becoming the premier provider of all the iTTi accredited courses, like 120-hour TESOL, Professional Teaching Certificate and the General English Enhancement course.</p>
                        <p>Conway has registered with OET.org to present the OET Preparation course and SEATA is accredited by Cambridge to present IELTS Preparation and Review.  </p>
